## High-Level Summary
Our project focuses on developing a technological solution to improve agricultural management through an app and an IoT device shaped like an onion. This device collects data from the soil and environment, such as humidity, NPK, electrical conductivity, pH, CO2, and solar radiation. By combining this data with satellite information from NASA, including temperature, heat index, CO2, humidity, UV, and evapotranspiration, a machine learning (ML) model is used to provide predictions and recommendations to farmers.

The goal is to help optimize resource use, particularly water, in contexts where scarcity is a recurring issue. The mobile app integrates all this data, presenting real-time information, alerts, and recommendations in an intuitive way, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and improve the efficiency of their crops, reducing costs and maximizing sustainability.

The project is also designed for scalability, as it can be adapted from small farms to large-scale global agricultural systems. Over time, as more data is collected, the predictive models will become more accurate, expanding the positive impact on sustainable farming
